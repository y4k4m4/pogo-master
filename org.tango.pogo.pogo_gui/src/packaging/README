1 - INTRODUCTION
----------------
This is the README for the TANGO classes source code release.
 
TANGO is a toolkit for building object oriented control systems 
based on CORBA. TANGO is a collaboration effort of synchrotron radiation sources.

The TANGO classes source code release allows to add Tango classes one by
one to your Tango system. After installation and compilation, the class
can be used as standalone Tango device server or can be added to any
new device server by editing the ClassFactory.cpp file and linking with
the created archive or shared library for the installed class.

The package is intended for Unix platforms. The source code contained 
in this package might run on Windows but the Makefile don't. Check for a 
special Windows release for the class.


2 - WHAT'S INSIDE
-----------------
This source code release contains all necessary source files for a Tango 
class to build an executable device server and an archive and shared library
for the class.
Documentation is provided as an html file with pointers to the centralized 
classes documentation.


3 - PREREQUISITES
-----------------

Before compiling and installing a Tango class you need to install :

(1) omniORB 
	 
(2) Tango available from http://www.tango-controls.org/download 

(3) zmq

Also check the tools you are using

(4) If you are using gcc. You can download gcc from http://gcc/gnu.org


4 - CONFIGURATION
-----------------

Once you have installed the packages in prerequisites you can think
about configuring and compiling Tango classes.
To configure your Tango class package you need to tell it where to find 
the omniORB, zmq and Tango include files and libraries.

							 
To indicate the installation directory use the --prefix option.
Without specification the default prefix will be set to AUTHORTANGO_ROOT/classes
to install the class with your Tango installation.

Set PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable to Tango lib path to use TANGO pkgconfig

You can type "configure --help" to get a print of all the options
supported by the configure script.


5 - COMPILATION
---------------

Once the configure script ran successfully you can compile and install the
executable, include files and libraries. Do this by typing :

make all

make install

The result should be the installation of the Tango class include files
under prefix/include, a class executable under prefix/bin, the class
libraries under prefix/lib and the documentation under prefix/doc.

By default the executable will be linked with the static class libraries!
To change this default behvior an to link with the shared class libraries
you can use the configure option --enable-shared-classes.


6 - RUNNING
-----------
To run the compiled Tango device server and to configure its properties
you should use the Tango configuration wizard available with Jive and
Astor.

(1) Jive:
    Start Jive and go to the Tools menu and start the "Server Wizard".
	 Just follow the instructions or have a look to
	 
	 http://www.esrf.eu/computing/cs/tango/tango_doc/tools_doc/astor_doc/movies/wizard.html
	 
	 before using the wizard.
	 In this case you will be asked to start your Tango server manually.
	 Your server will start-up empty (without any device defined!) and
	 will restart with the new configuration when the configuration 
	 with the wizard is finished.
	 
(2) Astor:
	 When using the Tango Starter server and Astor to administer your Tango 
	 system you can use the configuration wizard from Astor.
	 See the Astor documentation from 
	 
	 http://www.tango-controls.org/tools
	 
	 and the chapter "Start a New Server".
	 

7 - UPDATING from CVS
---------------------
The package contains in the source directory all necessary CVS 
directories, using an anonymous CVS access, to verify and update 
the class source code from the CVS.

Go to the source directory and run cvs status
to check for any source code modifications for this Tango class.


8 - DOCUMENTATION
-----------------
All necessary references are available from the html documentation file
delivered with this package (doc/TangoClassesDocumentation.html).

Don't forget to check the Tango manual installed the the
Tango package ( AUTHORTANGO_ROOT/doc/tango_x.x.pdf).


9 - REMARKS
-----------
In the case of dependencies of this class to abstract classes or other
Tango classes, the configure script will exit with an error.
You need to download the necessary classes first. After installation of 
the missing classes you can indicate the installation path in two ways:

(1) By defining the envirnment variables TANGO_CLASSES_ROOT to
    the base directory of Tango classes installation.
				export TANGO_CLASSES_ROOT=/users/xxx/packages/tango_classes
				
(2) Or by using the configure option --with-tango-classes-prefix.
	 			configure --with-tango-classes-prefix=/users/xxx/packages/tango_classes

To indicate the installation directory use the --prefix option.
Without specification the default prefix will be set to AUTHORTANGO_CLASSES_ROOT
to install the class with the other Tango classes.

When installing classes to AUTHORTANGO_ROOT/classes the specification of 
TANGO_CLASSES_ROOT or --with-tango-classes-prefix is not necessary!


10 - QUESTIONS
-------------

In the case of problems of further questions, send a mail to the Tango
mailing list (tango@esrf.fr). See the html documentation delivered with 
this package to find how to subscibe to the mailing list.
