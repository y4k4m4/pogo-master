        This application is supposed to be able to re-load a class generated with
        a Pogo-6.x application.<Br>
        If Pogo-6.x can load it, pogo-7 is also able to load it. Open the XXXX.h file.<Br>
        Open the XXXX.h file.
        <Br>
        <b>BUT:</b><Br>
        <ul>
            It will try to insert your own code at right place.<Br>
            Of course all cases cannot be tested:
            <ul>
            <li> Something could be missing (test your server before other modication)
            <li> Sometimes it could fail and do not insert part of code.<Br> <Br>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        When it load an old project it will propose:<Br>
        <img src=img/Pogo-generate-1.jpg><Br><Br>
        The code insertion is available only for <b>C++</b><br>
        If code insertion fails, or for <b>Python</b> and <b>Java</b>, generate class only and add your code by
        copy/paste action.<Br>

        <br>
        <b>For C++</b><br>
        If insertion works and compilation fails, most of the time it is due to:
        <ul>
            <li> Declaration duplicated(one by generator, one by code insertion).
            <li> For writable attribute, in write_MyAttribute method, the attr.get_write_value()<Br>
                    method management has changed. It is now returned in a local variable.<Br>
                    Your old global variable does not exist any more (it is not necessary to be global in 99% of cases).<Br>
                    It now local and named : <b>w_val</b>.
            <li> Take care in <b>dev_state()</b> and <b>dev_status()</b> methods if you override the default. </li>
            ones.

        </ul>
        <Br>
        <Br>
        Of course a class generated by this Pogo version is not able to be re-loaded by Pogo-6.x.x application.
